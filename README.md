# SafeSpace
The program ranks the overall safety of Universities in the US chosen by the user using a open govt dataset. It provides the safest campus for each chosen university and also gives a score to see how each university compares in safety to other institutions of similar size
Developed a desktop application with a team of 5  that outputs the details on university safety compared to other universities in America based on user preferences on the crime using a university crimes database from data.gov. Played an important role leading the team, organizing the database and implementing the search algorithm that fetches the university, the campus, and the crime data based on the user input in order to calculate the safest university.

Responsiblities include managing and leading a team of 5 people and designing and implementing the search algorithm that fetches the university, the campus, and the crime data based on the user input in order to calculate the safest university. Helped design the compare algorithm where selected university is compared with universities of similar sizes
